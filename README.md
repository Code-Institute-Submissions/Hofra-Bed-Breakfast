A genuine website for my friends Hofra Bed & Breakfast. The website features a welcoming page, information
 on the rums, the barn, intresting destinations and inviting images.

This website will be the first and my friends gave me the opportunity to code the website for their first business. 
There will be changes to this website in the future along with my learning process. 
I'm very excited and nervous at the same time. My biggest fear is this readme file.

#### The business goals of this website are
- Provide information about the different features
- Provide intresting destination near by, Dellendistrict shall be the final destination
- Provide warm and inviting images

#### Customer goals of this website
- Guest shall feel welcomed
- Pinpoint information on each feature
- Easy to find contact information

#### Future goals and features
- Get companies to have their conferences at Hofra Bed & Breakfast
- A second, much smaller barn will be added
- The income from the B&B shall cover one persons yearly income

## UX
#### The ideal guest for this business is:
- Wants to stay without any distractions
- Wants to stay for a longer time not just one night

#### Visitors to this website are searching for:
- Intresting place to stay
- A different place to celebrate their important day in live
- Finding activities during their stay
