A genuine website for my friends traditional Hofra Bed & Breakfast. The website features what Hofra Bed & Breakfast stands for, a view into the rums and the barn, 
what you could do if staying longer and how to book and where to find the Hofra B&B.

This website will be the first ever website I coded. My friends gave me the opportunity to code their website. There will be changes to this website in the future along with my learning process. 
I'm very excited and nervous at the same time. My biggest fear is this readme file.
