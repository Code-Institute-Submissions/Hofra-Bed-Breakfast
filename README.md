A genuine website for my friends Hofra Bed & Breakfast. The website features a welcoming page, information
 on the rums, the barn, intresting destinations and inviting images.

This website will be the first and my friends gave me the opportunity to code the website for their first business. 
There will be changes to this website in the future along with my learning process. 
I'm very excited and nervous at the same time. My biggest fear is this readme file.

The business goals of this website are
- Provide information of the different branches
- Provide intresting destination near by
- Provide warm and inviting images

Customer goals of this website
- Guest shall feel welcomed
- Pinpoint information on each branch
- Easy to get in contact and book

Future goals and features
- Get companies to have their conferences at Hofra Bed & Breakfast
- HÃ¤lsingland shall be the guest's final destination/ for ever home
