A genuine website for my friends traditional Hofra Bed & Breakfast. The website features what Hofra Bed & Breakfast stands for, a view into the rums and the barn, 
what you could do if staying longer and how to book and where to find the B&B.

This website will be the first ever website I coded. My friends gave me the opportunity to code their website. There will be changes to this website in the future along my learning process. 
I'm very excited and nervous at the same time. My biggest fear is this readme file.

The goals of this website are
*People want to stay at Hofra Bed & Breakfast
*To celebrate their important days in life
*Experience a Hälsingegård and it's surroundings


Future goals and features
*Get companies to have their conferences at Hofra Bed & Breakfast
*Open the second, smaller, barn for conferences or smaller festivities



*Welcome
*Our rums
*The barn
*Experience Dellen and it's surroundings
*Contact
